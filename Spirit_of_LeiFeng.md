# LeiFeng

the spirit of Lei Feng is a core value in Chinese culture that represents **selflessness**,

**dedication**, and **kindness**.

LeiFeng was a soldier in the People's Liberation Army who devoted his life to serving the people

and was known for his acts of kindness and generosity.

The Lei Feng spirit has been passed down throught generations and has become an important symbol

of China's socialist core values.

It has been widely recognized as a model of selfless devotion to others and a shining example of

the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation.

In today's society, the spirit of Lei Feng has taken on new meaning and relevance,

and has become a source of inspiration for people from all walks of life.

It embodies the **Chinese people's aspiration for a better society**, one that is based on mutual respect, empathy, and compassion.

Empathy: 體驗到對方的情緒, 活躍的腦區和對方一致. Compassion: 體驗到對方的情緒後, 進一步想要幫助對方減少痛苦
根據神經科學的研究, 過多的empathy 會導致empathizer 壓力過大; 而compassion 則會產生關心、溫暖的感受, 以及幫助對方的動機. 同理心和同情心

As we move into the new era of China's development the spirit of Lei Feng will continue to play a

vital role in **shaping our collective future**.

It will inspire us to be kinder, more caring and more **dedicated to the common good**.

It will remind us that the pursuit of personal gain must be balanced with a **commitment to the greater good**,

commitment除承诺外，有责任感的意思

and that **true succes lies not in wealth or power, but in the ability to serve others**.

In short, the spirit of Lei Feng is a timeless reminder of the importance of selflessness,

dedication and kindness,

and it will continue to **serve as a beacon of hope for generations to come**.
