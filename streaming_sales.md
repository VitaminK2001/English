### Advantages of Streaming Sales Online

One of the biggest advantages of streaming sales online is the ability to reach a wider audience. With the internet, businesses can sell their products and services to customers all over the world, without needing a physical storefront. This makes it easier for small businesses to compete with larger companies, and allows them to expand their customer base beyond their local area.

Another advantage of streaming sales is the convenience it offers to the customer. Instead of having to visit a brick-and-mortar store to make a purchase, customers can simply place an order online and have it delivered to their doorstep. This saves time and energy, and allows customers to shop from the comfort of their own home.

### Disadvantages of Streaming Sales Online

While there are many benefits to streaming sales online, there are also some disadvantages that must be considered. One of these is the lack of personal interaction between the seller and the customer. When shopping online, customers miss out on the opportunity to see and touch products before buying them, and may have questions or concerns that cannot be addressed through the website.
